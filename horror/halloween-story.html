“You really want to know what I saw that day in Conner
Field?<p>
“Don’t look at me like I’m some crazy old man. I’m
surprised I’m still together at all after seeing a thing like
that.<p>
“It was more than that. Of course I was almost out of
my mind when I rounded that corner and found Teddy
dead. You’d think a dog would have the decency to die
at home, not two miles out in Conner Field. But Teddy
was thirteen years old, and he was eighty-three
pounds—so that’s about right.<p>
“Listen: I don’t care what you say. What happened
might have been somehow related to Teddy, but Teddy
wasn’t the cause of it. I mean, I wasn’t so grief-stricken
that my mind played a big trick on me. I know what I
saw—just as you know what you see—so have the
decency to pretend that you believe me. You’re my son.<p>
“I tried to pick Teddy up. He was too heavy. He’d died
right along the tree-line out there—I think I told you
that before—right at the end of Conner’s soybean field.
He’d run off ahead of me: Teddy liked to do that, you
know. Then he’d look back over his shoulder to make
sure you were still following. I loved that dog.<p>
“I had my hiking stick, and a lot of times I’d be poking
at the clumps of hard dry ground, so I didn’t notice right
off when Teddy stopped barking. I thought he’d just
tired himself out. But there was a kind of strange cold
wind right then, and all the leaves in that first row of
trees shook around; and above them the sky was so
dreary that I got sad before I even found Teddy. I tell
you, I’ve never felt a mood like that before—and I hope I
never do again. You too for that matter.<p>
“I couldn’t believe he was really dead. It hurt my knees,
but I knelt all the way down and put my hand on
Teddy’s heart. His paws were angled down, and his eyes
were closed. At least he died peaceful, I thought.<p>
“Then I started sobbing. Teddy’s all I’ve got, you know,
now that your Mom’s been gone for six years. And I
hardly ever see you anymore. No, I’m not trying to
guilt-trip you. And even without all that stuff, a dog is
like a baby that never grows up, and you just love them
so much that it hurts really terrible when they finally
die.<p>
“I wanted to get him back home. I was thinking about
digging a hole out by the tree where your old tire swing
used to be. I kept petting that dog and talking to him
like he could still hear me, and all the time I was crying
and trying to get a hold of myself. I tell you, if he’d of
just died at home I might have reacted different. Maybe
ten years ago I could have picked that dead dog up—but
when I tried that day, I could really feel how old and
frail I’m getting. Getting old is hell. So just as I was
thinking about where I was going to bury that dog, I
saw, through a gap in the trees against the grey sky, the
black outline of a man about a hundred yards off. He
stood there just as still as a statue. I could tell he was
looking right at me, and this horrible dread ran like a
centipede right up through my cold spine.<p>
“I took my hand off of Teddy. There was a catch in the
back of my throat, and it was hard for me to call
out—but I was hoping that it was only Conner standing
over there. I coughed the dryness out, and finally
managed to shout:<p>

“‘That you, Conner?’<p>
“But just as I’d feared, the odd figure remained silent.
My knees were stiff. I pushed myself up and got a solid
stance with the help of my hiking stick.<p>
“How do I know it wasn’t one of Conner’s kids? Christ,
I know them all. None of them look or act like that.<p>
“‘You there,’ I shouted—but the only answer came from
the rustling trees and the distant shouts of a crow.<p>
“I was angry now. It seemed somehow offensive that
this drab figure had cut in on my moment with Teddy. I
wanted to know who it was, and why they were being so
damned mysterious. I got to thinking that it was some
high-school kid who was trying to get a rise out of me,
but the more I studied the figure, the more disturbed I
got.<p>
“The man was too tall to be a kid. And there was
something off about its posture. I could see the thin
make of one of its hands against the lighter sky—and I
got to thinking that it was some kid in a costume maybe,
seeing how it was just a few days before Halloween.<p>
“No—I’m positive that it wasn’t. The thought went
through my mind: but that was no costume. I squinted
and looked as hard as I could, and the fear was working
down into my knees even. I felt all wobbly, you know.
That was when it happened: the man started toward me
through the small tangle of trees, and he moved like a
ghost.<p>
“Well of course I turned and ran—wouldn’t you? I
almost tripped and fell on those dry rows of tilled-up
earth, but I went as fast as an eighty-one year old man
can go, and the sun was right in my eyes, and the field
felt so quiet without the barking of Teddy and just the
sound of my shoes in the dirt. For a good minute I
never turned around. But then I got so tired that I had
to stop, but figured on looking over my shoulder first
before I did, you know.<p>
“And he was gone, whatever it was. I could see the
clump of woods back there, and the flat light rows of
ground like anthills. I pushed my hiking stick into the
dirt and leaned all my weight on it. I started feeling like
a fool. Then I replayed what had happened to see if
maybe my mind had tricked me somehow—and for just
a moment I felt really old and useless. You’ll see what I
mean someday if you live long enough. I felt suddenly
trapped in this wrinkly skin, with these cracking knees
and a nose that’s twice as big as it used to be. But the
thought that some kind of joke was being played on me
came back, and then this terrible thought came to me:
that whatever I had seen was somehow responsible for
killing Teddy. That gave me new strength. So I turned
and started walking back.<p>
“I saw it again, standing as still as a scarecrow with its
arms at its sides. It had moved over closer to Teddy,
and I could tell, in fact, that it was standing right over
the dead dog. Now I was really mad, but it was mixed
with that same fear that I had before, and I couldn’t
bring myself to go any closer to the dark thing. I picked
up a stone and lobbed it toward the scene, and I yelled:<p>
“‘Get away from my dog!’<p>
“The rock hit the strange man. I say ‘hit’ because I
watched it go into the darkness of the figure, but it
made no sound—and the thing scarcely noticed. I think
it only heard my voice.<p>
“Now it came at me again with new vigor. I was too
tired to run, so I simply fell backward and readied
myself with my walking stick, thinking I’d at least stab
the bastard one time before it got to me. I have never
seen something move in the same way as that terrible
thing. I could see no feet beneath the layers of dark rags
that covered it, but as it drew up over me I could see
quite clearly the face of the thing—the most awful thing
I have ever seen.<p>
“It looked somewhat like the face of a horse. Its eyes
were white, and all of the skin on the face was loose and
pale and hairless. I closed my eyes in terror, and pursed
my lips. I felt the hot breath of the thing as it studied
me, and heard its grunts. It placed a large and spidery
hand on my chest and felt for my heartbeat. Then,
finding that I was still alive, it floated off beyond me. I
crawled up from the dirt and watched it go away, kind of
gliding like a bird that is low to the ground.<p>
“What do I think it was? Why, death of course—or one
of His animal messengers. Perhaps it had come to
gather Teddy’s soul, and thought that mine was almost
ready as well.<p>
“Don’t you look at me like that: I know what I saw. And
you’re the one who wanted to hear about it anyway.<p>
“I’m perfectly happy to keep a story like that to myself.”
