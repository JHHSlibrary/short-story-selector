  A frog dictionary would say that a fly is a winged creature that moves through the air under control. But it’s not only this. Flies are crunchy and delicious, somewhat like toasted peanuts to frogs. This delicacy has yet been introduced to humans, and I pray it never will.<p>
In the 1990’s, when I was a young child, I had the opportunity to taste this (to frogs) sumptuous meal. It was something that I will never forget, and even when I’m placed in my coffin, the last supper I will have, will taste like the ruminants of flies.<p>
When I was twelve, I was a hard working child. I worked in the temple gardens in the mornings, moving carts of rocks and stones, then placing them to make a border-fence around flower beds; in the afternoons I would work in the kitchens, washing dishes for hours and then drying vegetables in the sun and collecting those of the yesterday’s. By six in the evenings, I would hurry to the Buddha hall to attend Evening Ceremony—this was my daily schedule. However, by six, I was so tired that I would fall asleep standing where I was, like a horse. It so happens that I usually had a lot of bad luck, and it so happens that I was standing next to my guardian. I was not allowed to sleep during ceremonies.<p>
“Sing!”  Gwei-Shr commanded. She was trying to keep me awake.<p>
I sang. I sang loudly the Buddha names and sutras we had to recite.<p>
“Louder!”<p>
I sang louder.<p>
“Louder!”<p>
I could feel cracks around my mouth as I stretched it wide to the point of pain.<p>
Now, it was a very hot summer when it happened. There were many people in the Buddha hall praying, and the air was filled with moist-sour smells from people. The hall was filled with flies. As they buzzed in and out, they looked like markings on an invisible polka-doted sheet of fabric.<p>
Then, I saw it. I saw a large fly zoom past me. Its wings flapping madly as it flew through the crowd of people. I made sure to close my mouth when it flew by me.<p>
But of course, I am always full of bad luck. Midway flying across the hall, it made a sharp turn to fly headlong toward my direction.<p>
“Louder!” Gwei-Shr cried.<p>
As I opened my mouth, the fly flew straight into my mouth and into my throat. It got stuck there.
The feeling I felt was a mixture of shock, disgust, and pity for the fly that might die. I did not want to swallow it, but I did not know how to get it out of my throat without killing it. I turned to my guardian and tugged at her sleeve.<p>
“I have a fl..y in . . ,” I said pointing to my throat, trying hard not to swallow or hurt the fly.
“What?”<p>
“I . . . have a fl . . .y in my throat,” I said, trying to speak more clearly.<p>
“Oh!” Gwei-Shr said, “Quickly go drink some water!”<p>
She told Ying, my best friend, to go to the bathroom with me. When we got in the bathroom, Ying asked me what was wrong. I tried telling her without swallowing. I didn’t know how much longer I could hold the fly in my throat.<p>
“Can you spit it out?” she asked.<p>
“Not without killing it,” I said.<p>
“Well, maybe you can spit it out without killing it.”<p>
“I can’t. It’s too deep in,” I said pointing to where the fly was as I felt it trying to move upward, its legs scratching my throat.<p>
“What should I do?” I asked.<p>
“What did Gwei-Shr tell you to do?”<p>
“Drink water, but that will kill the fly.”<p>
“Well, if she says to drink water, then just do so.”<p>
Ying got me a cup of water from the nearby water dispenser. She gave me the cup.<p>
There was nothing for me to do. I would kill the fly either way even if I didn’t want to and our guardian told me to drink water. She must know better. I drained the cup. As the cool water flowed down my throat, I could feel the fly stuck for a moment and then flushed downed into my system. I felt awful. Just then Gwei-Shr came in the bathroom.<p>
“Is the fire gone?” she asked.<p>
“There was no fire,” I said, ” It was a fly.”<p>
