His name is Jean. You’ve had a Jean, or a pair of Jeans.<p>
Thrift store variety: the kind you only wear around the house, the kind your mom would tell you to throw out if only she knew. If anyone knew. That you bury it in a deep dark hole and climb in so you can love it all by yourself.<p>
The ones you keep in circulation for a quick minute, before you see a picture of yourself in them, with them. When you succumb to a fad you thought you were too smart to follow. The kind you hide in the back of the closet, ready to blame it on the times, on the back-whens.<p>
The kind you take home just because it is on sale. Because an extra pair never hurts. Because why the hell not. Because if it doesn’t work out, no big loss. Because easy come, easy go. Because it will go.<p>
The ones with the stain on the pocket. Or a missing belt loop. Or an unraveling seam. You thought you could live with it. That the discount would make up for it. That you’re well aware of the sacrifices you must make to get a good deal. That you wouldn’t resent it.<p>
The ones you got when you went shopping with friends.<p>
The ones when you went shopping alone.<p>
The brand name kind. The ones you keep around because you already paid so much for them, even if they don’t fit right anymore.<p>
Those tight ones, just in case you lose weight some day. The kind that starts as hopeful. The kind that makes you force it. The kind that makes you feel bad, every time you look at it.<p>
The ones that sag at the ass, threadbare on the thighs, trampled on the hems. The ones you’ve had forever. Like second skin. You don’t bother for new ones. Like a cicada too numb, too tired to crawl out, who curls up in its ill-fitting exoskeleton, listlessly buzzing on a tree.<p>
* *<p>
This is like this.<p>
* *<p>
But sometimes it’s like this:<p>
These right here are something else. Maybe not perfect but they fit you perfectly. The kind that stretches with your shape, your mood. Not how you were before. Or how you wish you could be. But what you are now.
People ask you where you found them–you tell them, they found you. That you took a break from shopping. That you don’t know where they came from, they were actually a gift.<p>
You make each other look good: they hug your curves and show you off; you make them look expensive. You slip your hands in their pockets, so you can feel them, feeling you.<p>
You never thought it was possible to feel comfort and excitement at the same time.<p>
You’ve always liked to walk around naked, but you could walk with these any day.<p>
